# Codex: Necrons

## Codex Special Rules

  ### Reanimation Protocols:
  At the start of each of Remove Casualties step, this unit's Reanimation Protocols are enacted if the unit suffered any
  casualties since the last time they were enacted.

  When a unit's Reanimation Protocols are enacted, each model in it that would now be removed from the battlefield as a
  casualty has a chance to Reanimate itself and return to battle. This is done in two steps:
  1. **Reactivation:** Roll a D6 for the model (this is a "Reactivation roll").
  On a 5+, the model is Reactivated - proceed to step 2. Otherwise, the model fails to Reanimate.
  2. **Reassembly:** Roll another D6 for the model (this is a "Reassembly roll"). If the result of the roll is higher than
  the model's Wounds characteristic, or in an unmodified 6, the model is successfully Reassembled and Reanimated. Otherwise,
  the model fails to Reanimate.

  Models that are successfully Reanimated are NOT removed during this Remove Casualties step, regain all lost wounds and 
  no longer count as having been destroyed or otherwise made a casualty. All the rest are removed as normal.
  
  Both Reactivation and Reassembly rolls are considered Reanimation Protocol rolls for purposes of other rules.
  
  Each time a unit's Reanimation Protocols are enacted, you can make rolls for all models with the same Wounds characteristic
  all at once, instead of individually, and determine after rolling which model each success (after both rolls) applies to.
  
  In addition, each time a unit's Reanimation Protocols are enacted, if ALL the models in it have been destroyed (that is, 
  the whole unit will be removed if all Reanimation Protocol rolls fail), this is considered a "Critical Reanimation".
  During a Critical Reanimation, all Reanimation Protocol rolls suffer a -1 penalty.
  
  A single Reanimation Protocol roll cannot be modified by more than +1 or -1 after all the modifiers are totalled.
  
  ### Command Protocols:
  (TODO)
  
  ### Cold Hard Logic:
  This unit ignores the effects of "Panicking" and is never considered to have this status. However, if this unit would receive
  this status as a result of a failed Morale test, do the following:
   - If more than half (rounded down) of its starting number of models are still present on the battlefield (even if they were destroyed but haven't yet been removed as casualties), nothing happens.
   - Otherwise, the units phases out - remove it from the battlefield at the end of the current battle phase (it counts as destroyed but this doesn't cause strain to nearby friendly units).
  
  _Example: A unit of Necron Warriors, which counted 10 models at the start of the game, takes a Morale test and fails with a
  large enough margin to warrant gaining the Panicking status. If at least 6 models are still present, the unit simply ignores
  this status. But if only 5 or fewer models are present, it will phase out at the end of the battle phase. If the unit had 
  originally counted 15 models, it would need more than 7 (so at least 8) models in order to not phase out._
  
  ### Living Metal:
  At the start of your Command phase, each model in this unit regains 1 lost wound.
  
  ### Hardwired for Destruction:
  When rolling to hit for an attack made by this unit, you may re-roll a 'tens' roll of 1.
  TODO: Fearless, but...?
  
  ### Dimensional Translocation:
  \[Same as Deep Strike]

  ---
  
  ### \[Philosophy] Keyword and Special Rule allocation:
  
  **CORE:** "Normal" (and mostly humanoid) Necrons, such as Lords, Overlords, Warriors, Immortals etc. will get CORE. Probably Destroyers too, even if they are a little bit insane and not so humanoid anymore. CANOPTEK things and especially large monsters will NOT be CORE.

  **Standard Core traits:** All "Normal" Necrons, i.e. those that get CORE, will all have the following special rules: **Reanimation Protocols**, **Command Protocols**, **Living Metal** and **Cold Hard Logic**.
  - Exception: DESTROYER CULT units will not get **Cold Hard Logic** (because they are insane) but they will get **Hardwired for Destruction**.
    
  **Standard Canoptek traits:** All CANOPTEK units will have the following special rules: **Command Protocols**, **Living Metal** and **Fearless**.
  
  For other units (which there aren't so many of) special rules will be determined on a case-by-case basis.

## Dynasties
  
  ### Mephrit
  (we like to shoot)
  - **\[Ability] Solar Fury:** Each time a model in this unit makes an attack with a ranged weapon (excluding those with **Flamer Template** and **Blast (...)**), the target unit is considered to be 2" closer than it actually is (this applies to determining whether the target is within range, as well as to range-dependent effects such as Rapid Fire, those confered by Command Protocols, and others). In addition, each time a model in this unit makes a ranged attack, if the wound roll is 61 or higher, you can choose to resolve the attack with damage 2.
  - **\[Stratagem] Name:** ?
  - **\[Relic] Name:** ?
  - **\[Warlord Trait] Name:** ?
  - **\[Favoured Command Protocols]:** **Zero-in**, ? (rapid fire thing)
  
  ### Nephrekh
  (we like to teleport)
  - **\[Ability] Translocation Beams:** Models in this unit have a 6+ invulnerable save. In addition, when this unit
Advances or Disengages, you may choose to have it Translocate - if it does, models in it can move horizontally through terrain and
other models when resolving this Advance or Disengage move, but the unit will not be eligible to perform any actions in the following
Shooting phase. Units that Disengage by Translocating cannot be pursued.
  - **\[Stratagem] Translocation Crypt (1CP):** Use this Stratagem before the battle when declaring reserves and transports (if you are playing a mission without this step, use this Stratagem during deployment instead). Select one NEPHREKH unit (excluding VEHICLE or MONSTER units) from your army. That unit gains the Dimensional Translocation ability.
  - **\[Stratagem] Event Horizon Shift (2CP):** Use this Stratagem after a NEPREKH CORE unit Translocates using its **Translocation Beams** ability. 
That unit becomes unexhausted and can perform actions normally in the subsequent phases (even if it Disengaged in this way).
  - **\[Relic] Name:** ? (maybe: solar staff)
  - **\[Warlord Trait] Name:** ?
  - **\[Favoured Command Protocols]:** **Reinforce**, **Flash-blitz**
  
  **SPECIAL:** This dynasty unlocks 2 Stratagems (instead of 1).
  
  ### Nihilakh
  (we like to conquer)
  - **\[Ability] Aggresively Territorial:** When this unit is selected to shoot, if it is within 6" of an objective 
marker and all of its attacks are declared against enemy units that are within 6" of the same objective marker, this
unit gains the **Relentless** special rule until the end of the action. In addition, if this unit has the **Cold Hard 
Logic** special rule, while it is within 6" of an objective marker or wholly within its controlling player's
deployment zone, it counts as having 1 additional model for purposes of determining whether it will phase out.
  - **\[Stratagem] Name:** ?
  - **\[Relic] Name:** ?
  - **\[Warlord Trait] Name:** ?
  - **\[Favoured Command Protocols]:** **Lock Down**, **Defend**
  
  ### Novokh
  (we like to butcher people)
  - **\[Ability] Murder-crazed:** In the Fight phase, during Initiative step 1, if this unit is in Enagagement Range of
enemy units, each model in it can make 1 additional attack with any weapon it is equipped with. In addition... TODO
  - **\[Stratagem] Synthetic Bloodlust:** ? (something to re-roll charges or similar)
  - **\[Relic] Name:** ?
  - **\[Warlord Trait] Name:** ? (Violencemancer haha)
  - **\[Favoured Command Protocols]:** **Overcharge Servos**, **Overpower**

  ### Sautekh
  (we like to pretend we're the death guard)
  - **\[Ability] (some such) Advance:** ? (secondary: after advancing, rapid fire/pistol = assault)
  - **\[Stratagem] Name:** ?
  - **\[Relic] Name:** ?
  - **\[Warlord Trait] Name:** ?
  - **\[Favoured Command Protocols]:** **Coalesce**, **Fend off**
  
  ### Szarekhan
  (we like to make quality stuff)
  _You can't spell Szarekhan without zarek!_
  - **\[Ability] Uncanny Artificiers:** When this unit is selected to shoot, you may re-roll one hit roll and one wound
roll. In addition, when a model in this unit makes a melee attack, after the wound roll, if the attack would be resolved
with AP -1, resolve it with AP -2 instead (stacks with "Sunder" Command Protocol).
  - **\[Stratagem] Replicator Nanoscarabs (1 CP):** Use this Stratagem when a SZAREKHAN unit's Living Metal special rule
would be resolved to no effect (all the models in the unit are at full wounds). Before resolving that rule, if this unit
is below its starting strength, you can return one previously destroyed model to the unit with 1 remaining wound - place
it anywhere in Unit Coherency with the existing models; if this is not possible, you cannot use the Stratagem. A single
unit can only be affected by this Stratagem once per battle.
  - **\[Relic] (none)**
  - **\[Warlord Trait] Name:** ?
  - **\[Favoured Command Protocols]:** **Shield**, **Sunder**

  **SPECIAL:** This dynasty does not unlock a Relic. However, each SZAREKHAN NECRON CHARACTER model may be equipped with
an Empyric Damper (+15 pts). Models equipped with Empyric Dampers can each do a Deny the Witch roll once per phase, as
if they were PSYKERs.

  ### Mokhor
  - **\[Ability] Rad-wreathed:** All non-MOKHOR and non-C'TAN SHARD units that are within 2" of this unit have their
Strength characteristic reduced by 1 (down to a minimum of 1). In addition, when a model in this unit makes a ranged
attack with a Particle Weapon, if the weapon's **Particle Weapon** ability would activate (to double the number of
shots made), make 1 extra attack with that weapon.
  - **\[Stratagem] Radfire Canisters (1CP):** Use this Stratagem when a MOKHOR CANOPTEK unit is destroyed. The unit 
immediately explodes, as if it had the **Explodes** special rule with the following profile:
`Roll: 1+ Range: 6" Strength: 4 AP: 0 Qualities: This explosion affects only non-MOKHOR and non-C'TAN SHARD units.`
This is in addition to the unit's usual **Explodes** special rule (if any). Then, place a marker within 1/2" of this
unit. From the end of this phase, until the end of the same phase on the next battle round, the area within 6" of the
marker counts as difficult terrain. This unit must be removed from the battlefield during the next Remove Casualties
step (it cannot be kept by effect of Reanimation Protocols or equivalent rules).
  - **\[Relic] Entropy Sphere:** (pistol; roll 2d6 over S+T to ...)
  - **\[Warlord Trait] The Glow:** _The warlord's body exudes radiation so intense, that it burns flesh, scrambles
electronics, and makes the air around him glow as an eerie halo._ All non-MOKHOR and non-C'TAN SHARD units that are
within 2" of this WARLORD have their Toughness characteristic reduced by 1 (down to a minimum of 1).
  - **\[Favoured Command Protocols]:** **Flush Out**, **Enhance Multitasking**

  **SPECIAL:** All MOKHOR units gain **Rad-wreathed**, instead of only those with (TODO).

  ### Kyverkhynn
  (calculated but ruthless killers... but aren't all Necrons like that?)
  - **\[Ability] Name:** ?
  - **\[Stratagem] Name:** ?
  - **\[Relic] Name:** ?
  - **\[Warlord Trait] Name:** ?
  - **\[Favoured Command Protocols]:** **Calculate Weakpoint**, **Calibrate**

  ### Takhrit
  (we like to hide and engage from afar)
  - **\[Ability] Name:** ? (maybe: having 1 type of cover gives the other type of cover)
  - **\[Stratagem] Name:** ?
  - **\[Relic] Name:** ?
  - **\[Warlord Trait] Name:** ?
  - **\[Favoured Command Protocols]:** **Conceal**, ? (long range fire support)

  ### Vozkhol
  _The fluff for this Dynasty is that they are all brain-linked into something akin to a hive-mind, dominated by their
Overlord._
  - **\[Ability] Neural Singularity:** This unit's Reanimation Protocol rolls can be modified by up to +2 or -1
(instead of the usual +1 or -1). In addition, models in this unit receive a +1 bonus to their Reassembly rolls.
  - **\[Stratagem] Name (2CP):** Use this Stratagem in your Shooting phase, after a VOZKHOL unit from your army has
finished making its attacks. Select one enemy unit that was targeted by an attack made by a model in that unit this
phase. Until the end of the phase, each time an attack is made by a model in another friendly VOZKHOL unit against that
enemy unit, that attack's hit roll gains an Advantage.
  - **\[Relic] Mindshackle Scarabs:** ?
  - **\[Warlord Trait] Name:** ? (neuromancer)
  - **\[Favoured Command Protocols]:** **Assist Reanimation**, **Concentrate Fire**
  
 ### IDEAS
 - Extra range

## Command Protocols

  ### 1. Zero-in
  Each time a model affected by this protocol makes a ranged attack against a target within 12", the hit roll
  gains Advantage.

  ### 2. Assist Reanimation
  (something about reanimation protocols)

  ### 3. Calculate Weakpoint
  Each time a model affected by this protocol makes a melee attack while not being in Defensive stance, the wound roll
  gains Advantage.

  ### 4. Calibrate
  As soon as a unit is affected by this protocol, it starts calibrating, unless it already finished calibrating in one of the previous turns. 
  While a unit is calibrating, its Melee Skill and Ballistic Skill characteristics are reduced to 2 (unless they would otherwise be lower).
  Calibration finishes at the end of the current turn, and from that point on (for the remainder of the battle), whenever a model from the
  calibrated unit makes a melee or ranged attack against an enemy unit, the hit and/or wound roll may be re-rolled. A maximum of 3 re-rolls
  per phase, per unit, can be gained from this protocol.
  
  Note that after a unit has started calibrating, the effects (both positive and negative) of this protocol persist for their defined duration,
  regardless of whether there is a friendly NOBLE on the battlefield or the affected unit is In Disarray. This is an exception to the normal
  rules that all other command protocols follow.
  
  ### 5. Coalesce
  Each time a unit affected by this protocol unit uses its **Living Metal** special rule, each model in this unit regains
  1 additional lost wound. At the start of Morale phase, each unit affected by this protocol loses 1 Strain.

  ### 6. Conceal
  Each time a ranged attack targets a unit affected by this protocol at a range greater than 12", the hit roll of that attack
  gains an Impairment.

  ### 7. Concentrate Fire
  Each time a whole unit affected by this protocols declares all attacks against the same enemy unit when selected to
  shoot, wound rolls of all attacks that are made at a range of 12" or less gain Advantage.

  ### 8. Defend
  Enemy units that are within 1" of units affected by this protocol have their Attack characteristics reduced by 1, down to a
  minimum of 1.  

  ### 9. Enhance Multitasking
  Models affected by this protcol gain Advantage to all hit rolls for attacks made with Pistol-type weapons, and
  never count as being Flat-Footed in the Fight phase.

  ### 10. Fend Off
  When a unit affected by this protocols performs "Prepare to Repel" in the Charge phase, all models in it gain +1 Attack
  until the end of the following Fight phase.

  ### 11. Flash-blitz
  Each time a model affected by this protocol makes a melee attack while not being in Defensive stance, the hit roll
  gains Advantage.

  ### 12. Flush Out
  Each time a model affected by this protocol makes a ranged attack against a target within 12", the target receives no
  benefit of cover.

  ### 13. Lock Down
  Units affected by this protocol gain the **Objective Secured** special rule. If a model in such a unit already has this
  ability, that model counts as one additional model when determining control of an objective marker.
  
  ### 14. Overcharge Servos
  Add 1" to the Move and Charge Bonus characteristics of units affected by this protocol.

  ### 15. Overpower
  Each time a model affected by this protocol makes a melee attack while being in Aggressive stance, if its unit charged
  this turn, the Strength of the attack is improved by 1.
  
  ### 16. Reinforce
  Units affected by this protocol gain +1 to their Exhaustion rolls after arriving as Reinforcements.

  ### 17. Sunder
  Each time a model affected by this protocol makes an attack, after the wound roll is made, if the attack would be resolved
  with AP 0, it's resolved with AP -1 instead.
  
  ### 18. (name)
  (something for long range / Heavy fire)
  
  ### 19. (name)
  (rapid fire thing; fire Rapid Fire normally during Snap Shooting and without penalties)

  ### 20. Shield
  Each time a model affected by pthis protocol would lose a wound, roll a D6. On a roll of 6, the wound is not lost.
  
## Warlord Traits

  ### 1. (name)
  (something for endurance)
  
  ### 2. Veteran of a Thousand Millenia
  Increase this WARLORD's Ballistic Skill by 1 (to a maximum of 9) and Melee Skill by 1 (to a maximum of 10). 
  During each Fight phase, he may select 2 different Stances to fight in.
  
  ### 3. (name)
  ?
  
  ### 4. Envoy of the Silent King
  This WARLORD gains the 'NOBLE' keyword and its Nerve characteristic is increased by 1.
  
  ### 5. Short-circuit Tactician
  During your Command phase, if this WARLORD is on the battlefield, and if in the previous battle round you chose
  not to enact any Command Protocol, then in this Command phase you may choose to enact 2 (different) Command Protocols
  at the same time.
  
  ### 6. I'll Be Back
  Once per battle, this WARLORD's reanimation attempt (which means Rectivation roll + Reassembly roll) can succeed
  automatically (player's choice as to when to use this). After this effect is used, the WARLORD is inactive
  until the same phase of the next turn.
  TODO: Clarify the effect a bit (and what does inactive mean?)
  
  ### IDEAS:
  - Terrifying aura (strain)
  - Re-roll all melee hit and wound rolls
  - Gain Deep Strike; he and 1 unit he's joining autopass Exhaustion roll
  - +2" M (counts for Relentless March)
  - Undying (whatever that does)
  - Refund CP on 5+ (Logistics Optimizer)
  - My Name Is Madness / Corroded (Eroded) Mind
  - Something else for endurance

## Relics

  ### Trinary Orb
  Model with a Resurrection Orb only. The Trinary Orb replaces a Resurrection Orb, and works in exactly the same way, except
  that it can be used twice per battle, instead of once.
  
  ### Orb of Eternity
  ?
  
  ### Arrow of Infinity (maybe I could come up with a less generic name for this)
  ?
  
  ### Voltaic Staff
  ?
  
  ### Voidreaper
  ?
  
  ### Dimensional Anchor
  (bearer cannot use deep strike or equivalent, but units that deep strike within 6" autopass exhaustion roll / can deep strikw within 6" of enemy units instead of 8")
  
  ### IDEAS:
  - Something with (false) vacuum Decay
  
## Weapons

### Qualities

**Gauss Weapon:** This weapon ignores the Puny Force rule. Each time an attack is made with this weapon, wound rolls of 61 or
more always successfully wound the target. A wound roll of 61 or more that would successfully wound the target anyway is instead
resolved with Armour Penetration increased by 1.

**Tesla Weapon:** Each time an attack is made with this weapon, an unmodified hit roll of 61 or more scores 2 additional hits.

**Particle Weapon:** When this weapon targets a unit within half range, or the bearer hasn't moved in the previous Movement phase,
double the number of shots the weapon makes.

  Additional Relics

## Unit Datasheets

### \[Philosophy] Nerve scores
No units in this codex will have a Nerve score dependant on the number of models remaining in the unit - that's one
of their "special things".
- Canoptek - 9
- "Regular" Necrons - 10
- HQ - 11
- Top-end HQs - 12
- DESTROYER CULT units get -1 to the above rules because they are crazy

### \[Philosophy] Initiative scores
- Baseline is 2. They are indifferent zombie robots. This applies to "regular" necrons.
- Canopteks have baseline 3 because they are not zombified and not so indifferent.
- Close combat units get +1 because they are specialised for it.
- Some Elites can get a further +1 for being so elite.
- HQs get +1.
- DESTROYER CULT units get +1 to the above rules because they are, as previously stated, crazed.
