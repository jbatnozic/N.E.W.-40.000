# Codex: Necrons

## Codex Special Rules

  ### Reanimation Protocols:
  At the start of each of Remove Casualties step, this unit's Reanimation Protocols are enacted if the unit suffered any
  casualties since the last time they were enacted.

  When a unit's Reanimation Protocols are enacted, each model in it that would now be removed from the battlefield as a
  casualty has a chance to Reanimate itself and return to battle. This is done in two steps:
  1. **Reactivation:** Roll a D6 for the model (this is a "Reactivation roll").
  On a 5+, the model is Reactivated - proceed to step 2. Otherwise, the model fails to Reanimate.
  2. **Reassembly:** Roll another D6 for the model (this is a "Reassembly roll"). If the result of the roll is higher than
  the model's Wounds characteristic, or in an unmodified 6, the model is successfully Reassembled and Reanimated. Otherwise,
  the model fails to Reanimate.

  Models that are successfully Reanimated are NOT removed during this Remove Casualties step, regain all lost wounds and 
  no longer count as having been destroyed or otherwise made a casualty. All the rest are removed as normal.
  
  Both Reactivation and Reassembly rolls are considered Reanimation Protocol rolls for purposes of other rules.
  
  Each time a unit's Reanimation Protocols are enacted, you can make rolls for all models with the same Wounds characteristic
  all at once, instead of individually, and determine after rolling which model each success (after both rolls) applies to.
  
  In addition, each time a unit's Reanimation Protocols are enacted, if ALL the models in it have been destroyed (that is, 
  the whole unit will be removed if all Reanimation Protocol rolls fail), this is considered a "Critical Reanimation".
  During a Critical Reanimation, all Reanimation Protocol rolls suffer a -1 penalty.
  
  A single Reanimation Protocol roll cannot be modified by more than +1 or -1 after all the modifiers are totalled.
  
  ### Command Protocols:
  If every unit from your army (excluding DYNASTIC AGENT, Câ€™TAN SHARD and UNALIGNED units) is from the same Dynasty, and
  you select a NOBLE model to be your WARLORD, this unit is eligible to benefit from Command Protocols and the following
  rules apply.

  After both sides have deployed, but before you have determined who will be the first player, you must choose X Command
  Protocols (there is a list of 20 protocols later in the document), where X is the number of battle rounds the game
  will last (or the maximum number of battle rounds it could last if it's not predetermined). Only chosen protocols are
  available for this battle. Each chosen protocol must be unique.

  At the start of each battle round, before either player begins their Command phase*, if you have a NOBLE WARLORD on
  the battlefield (or in Reinforcements if it's currently battle round 1 or 2), you **may** select one of the available
  protocols to be activated and remain active for the remainder of the battle round. Normally, each protocol can only be
  activated once. However, if the activated protocol is one of those favoured by your army's Dynasty, and this is the 
  first time it has been activated (by your army) during this battle, choose and resolve one of the 
  following effects immediately upon activation:
  1. Gain 1 CP.
  2. This Command Protocol can be activated a second time later in the battle.

  *Note: If both sides have rules that need to be resolved at this time, the current First Player goes first.

  After a Command Protocol is activated, each unit with the **Command Protocols** special rule is affected by that
  protocol until the end of the battle round. Units that are In Disarray are not affected by Command Protocols unless
  otherwise stated.
  
  ### Dynastic Advisors:
  For each NOBLE included in a detachment, one CRYPTEK can be included in that detachment without taking up an 
  additional Battlefield Role slot.

  ### Cold Hard Logic:
  This unit ignores the effects of "Panicking" and is never considered to have this status. However, if this unit would receive
  this status as a result of a failed Morale test, do the following:
   - If more than half (rounded down) of its starting number of models are still present on the battlefield (even if they were destroyed but haven't yet been removed as casualties), nothing happens.
   - Otherwise, the units phases out - remove it from the battlefield at the end of the current battle phase (it counts as destroyed but this doesn't cause strain to nearby friendly units).
  
  _Example: A unit of Necron Warriors, which counted 10 models at the start of the game, takes a Morale test and fails with a
  large enough margin to warrant gaining the Panicking status. If at least 6 models are still present, the unit simply ignores
  this status. But if only 5 or fewer models are present, it will phase out at the end of the battle phase. If the unit had 
  originally counted 15 models, it would need more than 7 (so at least 8) models in order to not phase out._
  
  ### Living Metal:
  At the start of your Command phase, each model in this unit regains 1 lost wound.
  
  ### Hardwired for Destruction:
  When rolling to hit for an attack made by this unit, you must re-roll a 'tens' roll of 1.

  In the Morale phase, if this unit fails a Morale test, it becomes Crazed until the start of the next Morale phase.
  While Crazed:
   - In its Movement phase, this unit must make a Normal Move (as far as possible) towards the nearest visible enemy
  unit, unless it is already in Engagement Range of enemies, in which case it will Remain Stationary.
   - In its Shooting phase, it must shoot with as many ranged weapons as it can at the nearest visible enemy unit.
   - In its Charge phase, it must attempt to Charge and engage the nearest visible enemy unit (or do a Counter-charge if
  charged first).
   - Whenever a model in this unit uses this special rule to re-roll a 1, the unit takes a single wound (it may take an
  Armour or Invulnerable save).
   - This unit is **Fearless**.
  
  ### Dimensional Translocation:
  \[Same as Deep Strike]

  ### Quantum Shielding:
  Each time the model would suffer damage from an unsaved attack, roll a D6. If the result is not a 6, and is less than
  the damage inflicted by the attack, the damage is ignored. Mortal wounds are never affected by this rule.

  ### Phase Cycler: 
  This model has a 5+ invulnerable save.

  ### Phase Shifter: 
  This model has a 4+ invulnerable save.

  ---
  
  ### \[Philosophy] Keyword and Special Rule allocation:
  
  **CORE:** "Normal" (and mostly humanoid) Necrons, such as Lords, Overlords, Warriors, Immortals etc. will get CORE. Probably Destroyers too, even if they are a little bit insane and not so humanoid anymore. CANOPTEK things and especially large monsters will NOT be CORE.

  **Standard Core traits:** All "Normal" Necrons, i.e. those that get CORE, will all have the following special rules: **Reanimation Protocols**, **Command Protocols**, **Living Metal**, **Cold Hard Logic** and **Dynastic Ability**.
  - Exception: DESTROYER CULT units will not get **Cold Hard Logic** (because they are insane) but they will get **Hardwired for Destruction**.
    
  **Standard Canoptek traits:** All CANOPTEK units will have the following special rules: **Command Protocols**, **Living Metal** and **Fearless**.
  
  For other units (which there aren't so many of) special rules will be determined on a case-by-case basis.

## Dynasties
  
  If your army includes any NECRONS units, select which Dynasty they are from. Their \<DYNASTY\> keyword is replaced
  with the appropriate name (MEPHRIT for Mephrit, NEPREKH for Nephrekh, and so on). Each of these units gains the 
  Dynasty-specific ability as a special rule. The Dynasty-specific Stratagem, Relic and Warlord Trait are also unlocked 
  for your army to use.

  ### Mephrit

  - **\[Ability] Stellar Fury:** Each time a model in this unit makes an attack with a ranged weapon (excluding those 
with **Flamer Template** and **Blast (\*)**), the target unit is considered to be 2" closer than it actually is (this
applies to determining whether the target is within range, as well as to range-dependent effects such as Rapid Fire,
those confered by Command Protocols, and others). In addition, each time a model in this unit makes a ranged attack, if
the wound roll is 61 or higher, you can choose to resolve the attack with damage 2.
  - **\[Stratagem] Solar Flare (1CP):** Use this Stratagem at the start of the current first player's 
Shooting phase. Select 1 unexhausted MEPHRIT unit, counting 7 or more models armed with a ranged weapon; then select 1
enemy unit within 14" of the MEPHRIT unit and visible to the MEPHRIT unit. Until the end of both Shooting phases, the
MEPHRIT unit can target only the selected enemy unit with its ranged attacks; during its Shooting phase, it must attempt
to fire as many ranged weapons as possible at it, performing the Full Shooting action, if at all possible. Until the end
of the battle round, all ranged attacks made by the selected enemy unit suffer an Impairment to their hit rolls. 
  - **\[Relic] Bozar Spinner:** Equip to a MEPHRIT CHARACTER model armed with a Gauss exterminator. The Bozar Spinner
replaces the Gauss exterminator and has the profile described below.
  - **\[Warlord Trait] Starheart:** _The core of a dying star sits contained within this warlord's chest._ At the start
of your Shooting phase, you may select a friendly MEPHRIT unit within 6" of this WARLORD. Until the end of the phase,
all ranged weapons that unit is equipped with have their Strength characteristic improved by 1. In addition, this
WARLORD gains the **Explodes** special rule with the following profile:
`Roll: 4+ Range: 3" Strength: 8 AP: -3 Qualities: -`
  - **\[Favoured Command Protocols]:** **Zero-in**, **Press On**
  
  | WEAPON           | RANGE |     TYPE     |   S  | AP | D | QUALITIES
  |------------------|-------|--------------|------|----|---|---------------------------
  | Bozar Spinner    |  36"  | Rapid Fire 4 |   6  | -2 | 2 | **Gauss Weapon**

  ### Nephrekh

  - **\[Ability] Translocation Beams:** Models in this unit have a 6+ invulnerable save. In addition, when this unit
Advances or Disengages, you may choose to have it Translocate - if it does, models in this unit may move a maximum
distance equal to their Move characteristic + 6", or two their Move characteristic, whichever is lower (same as when
Advancing normaly) AND they may move horizontally through terrain features and other models while resolving this move.
After a unit Translocates, it becomes exhausted and not eligible to perform any actions in the following shooting
phase, but all ranged attacks targetting this unit in the following shooting phasesuffer an Impairment to their hit
rolls.
  - **\[Stratagem] Event Horizon Shift (2CP):** Use this Stratagem when a NEPREKH CORE unit Translocates using its
**Translocation Beams** ability. That unit and up to 1 NEPREKH CORE CHARACTER that may have joined it during the
Translocation becomes subject to the following effects: a) If it Disengaged using this ability, it cannot be Pursued;
b) After finishing the action, the unit becomes unexhausted and the effect of **Translocation Beams** no longer
prevents it from performing actions in the following shooting phase; c) The unit counts as having moved Normally.
All of the above are Command Effects.
  - **\[Stratagem] Translocation Crypt (1CP):** Use this Stratagem before the battle when declaring reserves and
transports (if you are playing a mission without this step, use this Stratagem during deployment instead). Select one
NEPHREKH unit (excluding VEHICLE or MONSTER units) from your army. That unit gains the **Dimensional Translocation**
special rule.
  - **\[Relic] Staff of Dawn:** Equip to a NEPREKH CHARACTER model armed with a Staff of light. The Staff of Dawn
replaces the staff of light and has the profile described below.
  - **\[Warlord Trait] Hyperlight Drifter:** This unit WARLORD gains the **Dimensional Translocation** special rule. If
it is set up on the battlefield using that rule, its Exhaustion rolls passes automatically. If it is set up together
with another unit (following the rules for CHARACTERS joining other units during the Reinforcements phase), that unit's
(max. 1 other unit can be affected by this) Exhaustion roll also passes automatically.
  - **\[Favoured Command Protocols]:** **Reinforce**, **Flash-blitz**
  
  **SPECIAL:** This dynasty unlocks 2 Stratagems (instead of 1).

  | WEAPON                       | RANGE |    TYPE   |   S  | AP | D | QUALITIES
  |------------------------------|-------|-----------|------|----|---|---------------------------
  | Staff of Dawn (melee)        | Melee | Melee     | User | -2 | 1 | -
  | Staff of Dawn (shooting)     |  18"  | Assault 3 |   5  | -2 | 1 | **Blinding Light**

  **Blinding Light:** If an attack made by this weapon hits an enemy unit, that unit cannot Fire Overwatch until the end
  of the battle round. If a model in that unit loses a wound as a result of this attack, that enemy unit also cannot
  delcare a Counter-charge until the end of the battle round.
  
  ### Nihilakh

  - **\[Ability] Aggresively Territorial:** When this unit is selected to shoot, if it is within 6" of an objective 
marker and all of its attacks are declared against enemy units that are within 6" of the same objective marker, this
unit gains the **Relentless** special rule until the end of the action. In addition, if this unit has the **Cold Hard 
Logic** special rule, while it is within 6" of an objective marker or wholly within its controlling player's
deployment zone, it counts as having 1 additional model for purposes of determining whether it will phase out.
  - **\[Stratagem] Name (1CP):** Use this Stratagem when a NIHILAKH INFANTRY or NIHILAKH BEAST unit is selected to
shoot. Until the end of the action, models in this unit can make attacks with a Assault and Rapid Fire ranged weapons
against enemy units that are in Engagement Range of this unit. If they do, disregard the usual rules for firing at
enemy units locked in combat, but resolve all hit rolls as if firing Overwatch. This is a Command Effect. (name = TODO)
  - **\[Relic] Respite Inhibitor:** Equip to a NIHILAKH CHARACTER with the **Relentless March** special rule.  This
model's Move characteristic is increased by 2".
  - **\[Warlord Trait] Implacable Conqueror:** _Crush your enemies, see the driven before you..._ When a friendly 
NIHILAKH unit within 2" of this WARLORD (or this WARLORD) Pursues a Disengaging enemy unit and uses the 
**Sweeping Advance** Stratagem, and if this WARLORD is Pursuing the same enemy unit:
    - The Stratagem costs 0 CP to use.
    - You may re-roll any D6 rolled while resolving its effect.
  - **\[Favoured Command Protocols]:** **Lock Down**, **Defend**
  
  ### Novokh

  - **\[Ability] Murder-craze:** During your first Command phase, this unit may perform a Normal Move of up to 5". This
move must be towards the closest enemy unit. In addition, in the Fight phase, during Initiative step 1, if this unit is
in Enagagement Range of enemy units, each model in it can make 1 additional attack with any weapon it is equipped with.
  - **\[Stratagem] Synthetic Bloodlust (1CP):** Use this Stratagem at the start of the Fight phase. Select 1 CHARACTER
unit, or 1 non-CHARACTER unit, or both (in which case they must be within 2" of each other). You may only select units 
that have the **Murder-craze** special rule. Select 1 of the effects below and apply it to all selected units (this is a
Command Effect):
    1. This unit's Initiative characteristic is doubled (up to 10) until the end of the phase.
    2. Until the end of the phase, this unit's Initiative is calculated as if it had performed a Charge in the 
preceding Charge phase.
  - **\[Relic] Claw of Edward Flensinghands:** Equip to a NOVOKH CHARACTER model armed with a Flensing claw. This relic
replaces the Flensing claw and has the profile described below. (name = TODO)
  - **\[Warlord Trait] Violencemancer:** Whenever this WARLORD makes a melee attack while in the aggressive stance, you
may re-roll the hit roll and you may re-roll the wound roll.
  - **\[Favoured Command Protocols]:** **Overcharge Servos**, **Overpower**

  | WEAPON                       | RANGE |  TYPE |   S  | AP | D | QUALITIES
  |------------------------------|-------|-------|------|----|---|---------------------------
  | Claw of Edward Flensinghands | Melee | Melee | User | -2 | 1 | Each time an attack is made with this weapon, make 3 hit rolls instead of 1.

  Note: C'tan Shard <- Crimson God

  ### Sautekh

  - **\[Ability] Unstoppable Advance:** At the start of your Charge phase, if this unit is not in Engagement Range of
enemy units, you may roll a Morale test for it. If the test is successful, this unit may make a Normal Move of up to 2"
either towards the closest enemy unit or towards the closest objective marker. In addition, after this unit Advances in
the Movement phase, it can treat any or all Pistol-type and Rapid Fire-type weapons as Assault-type weapons in the
following Shooting Phase.
  - **\[Stratagem] Assert Control (1CP):** Use this Stratagem at any time. Select a SAUTEKH unit that is In Disarray
and/or Crazed (see **Hardwired for Destruction**) - the unit immediately loses any or all of those statuses.
  - **\[Relic] Directive Repeater:** Equip to a SAUTEKH CHARACTER model. During your Command phase, select a SAUTEKH
unit within 8" of this model, and select one Command Protocol that you have already used during this battle. Until the
end of this battle round, the selected unit benefits from that Command Protocol (in addition to any others).
  - **\[Warlord Trait] Unwavering Commander:** If this WARLORD is on the battlefield (or in Reserves if it is the 1st
or 2nd battle round), then once per battle round you may enact the effect of the **Command Re-Roll** Stratagem. This
does not consume a CP and does not count as a usage of this Stratagem.
  - **\[Favoured Command Protocols]:** **Coalesce**, **Fend off**

  ### Szarekhan

  _You can't spell Szarekhan without 'zarek'!_
  - **\[Ability] Uncanny Artificiers:** When this unit is selected to shoot, you may re-roll one hit roll and one wound
roll. In addition, when a model in this unit makes a melee attack, after the wound roll, if the attack would be resolved
with AP -1, resolve it with AP -2 instead (stacks with "Sunder" Command Protocol).
  - **\[Stratagem] Replicator Nanoscarabs (1 CP):** Use this Stratagem when a SZAREKHAN unit's Living Metal special rule
would be resolved to no effect (all the models in the unit are at full wounds). Before resolving that rule, if this unit
is below its starting strength, you can return one previously destroyed model to the unit with 1 remaining wound - place
it anywhere in Unit Coherency with the existing models; if this is not possible, you cannot use the Stratagem. A single
unit can only be affected by this Stratagem once per battle. This is a Command Effect.
  - **\[Relic] (none)**
  - **\[Warlord Trait] Netherforged Body:** Once per phase, one saving throw made for this WARLORD can succeed 
automatically (instead of rolling).
  - **\[Favoured Command Protocols]:** **Shield**, **Sunder**

  **SPECIAL:** This dynasty does not unlock a Relic. However, each SZAREKHAN NECRON CHARACTER model may be equipped with
an Empyric Damper (+15 pts). Models equipped with Empyric Dampers can each do a Deny the Witch roll once per phase, as
if they were PSYKERs.

  ### Mokhor
  - **\[Ability] Rad-wreathed:** All non-MOKHOR and non-C'TAN SHARD units that are within 2" of this unit have their
Strength characteristic reduced by 1 (down to a minimum of 1). In addition, when a model in this unit makes a ranged
attack with a Particle Weapon, if the weapon's **Particle Weapon** ability would activate (to double the number of
shots made), make 1 extra attack with that weapon.
  - **\[Stratagem] Radfire Canisters (1CP):** Use this Stratagem when a MOKHOR CANOPTEK unit is destroyed. The unit 
immediately explodes, as if it had the **Explodes** special rule with the following profile:
`Roll: 1+ Range: 6" Strength: 4 AP: 0 Qualities: This explosion affects only non-MOKHOR and non-C'TAN SHARD units.`
This is in addition to the unit's usual **Explodes** special rule (if any). Then, place a marker within 1/2" of this
unit. From the end of this phase, until the end of the same phase on the next battle round, the area within 6" of the
marker counts as difficult terrain. This unit must be removed from the battlefield during the next Remove Casualties
step (it cannot be kept by effect of Reanimation Protocols or equivalent rules).
  - **\[Relic] Entropy Sphere:** Equip to a MOKHOR CHARACTER. The Entropy Sphere is a ranged weapon with the profile
given below.
  - **\[Warlord Trait] The Glow:** _The warlord's body exudes radiation so intense, that it burns flesh, scrambles
electronics, and makes the air around him glow as an eerie halo._ All non-MOKHOR and non-C'TAN SHARD units that are
within 2" of this WARLORD have their Toughness characteristic reduced by 1 (down to a minimum of 1).
  - **\[Favoured Command Protocols]:** **Flush Out**, **Enhance Multitasking**

  **SPECIAL:** All MOKHOR units gain **Rad-wreathed**, instead of only those with the **Dynastic Ability** special rule.

  | WEAPON         | RANGE |   TYPE    | S | AP |  D  | QUALITIES
  |----------------|-------|-----------|---|----|-----|--------------------------- 
  | Entropy Sphere |   6"  | Pistol \* | 3 | -4 |  1  | This weapon can be used up to 6 times per battle .The first time it is fired, its type is Pistol 6. The second time it is used, its type is Pistol 5, and so on. Each time a successful hit is scored with this weapon, roll a 2D6. If the result is higher than the sum of the target unit's Strength and Toughness characteristics, the target unit suffers a mortal wound (in addition to any usual damage the weapon may deal).

  ### Takhrit
  - **\[Ability] Obscurity Slant:** This unit receives a +1 bonus to all Cover save rolls. In addition, all ranged
weapons this unit is equipped with have their range characteristics increased by 6" when targeting enemy units that see
this unit as Obscured.
  - **\[Stratagem] Obfuscation Algorithms (1CP):** Use this Stratagem before the battle when declaring reserves and
transports (if you are playing a mission without this step, use this Stratagem during deployment instead). Select one
TAKHRIT unit (excluding VEHICLE or MONSTER units) from your army. That unit gains the **Infiltrate** special rule.
  - **\[Relic] Refractor Field Generator:** Equip to a TAKHRIT CHARACTER model. While a friendly NECRONS unit is wholly
within 8" of this model, if that unit would be considered Completely Visible from the point of view of an enemy model
that is more than 8" away from this model, it is considered Partially Obscured instead, and if it would be considered 
Partially Obscured, it is considered Heavily Obscured instead.
  - **\[Warlord Trait] Night Crawler:** If this WARLORD begins its Movement phase in such a position that no enemy unit
sees it as Completely Visible, then:
    - Until the end of this Movement phase, if it performs a Normal move or Advance, it can move an extra 6".
    - At the end of the following Charge phase, if it made a Charge move, select one enemy unit in Engagement Range of
this warlord - that unit gains D3 strain.
  - **\[Favoured Command Protocols]:** **Conceal**, **Snipe**

  ### Vozkhol
  _The fluff for this Dynasty is that they are all brain-linked into something akin to a hive-mind, dominated by their
Overlord._
  - **\[Ability] Neural Singularity:** This unit's Reanimation Protocol rolls can be modified by up to +2 or -1
(instead of the usual +1 or -1). In addition, models in this unit receive a +1 bonus to their Reassembly rolls.
  - **\[Stratagem] Name (2CP):** Use this Stratagem in your Shooting phase, after a VOZKHOL unit from your army has
finished making its attacks. Select one enemy unit that was targeted by an attack made by a model in that unit this
phase. Until the end of the phase, each time an attack is made by a model in another friendly VOZKHOL unit (except units
that are In Disarray) against that enemy unit, that attack's hit roll gains an Advantage. (name = TODO)
  - **\[Relic] Mindshackle Scarabs:** At the start of Initiative step 20 in the Fight phase, you may select one enemy
model within 1/2" of the bearer. That model must immediately make a Morale test (with a -1 modifier to the 2D6 roll if
the model is a CHARACTER). If the test is failed, when it's that model's turn to attack in this Fight phase, the 
controlling player of the Mindshacke Scarabs' bearer selects the targets for the first 3 attacks (or up to 3 if the
model's Attack characteristic is lower than 3). In this case the model may attack friendly units or even its own unit.
If it survives this, it may make its remaining attacks (if any) as usual.
  - **\[Warlord Trait] Neuromancer:** Once per battle round, at the start of any phase, select one enemy unit visible to
this WARLORD and within 9" of it, and then choose one of the effects below to resolve:
    1. Until the end of the phase, whenever a model in the chosen unit would re-roll a hit roll, a wound roll, or a morale
test, you can choose to negate it and use the original roll instead.
    2. Until the end of the phase, whenever a model in the chosen unit would make a hit roll or a wound roll, that roll
cannot be affected by more Advantages than there are Impairments affecting it.
  - **\[Favoured Command Protocols]:** **Assist Reanimation**, **Concentrate Fire**

## Command Protocols

  ### 1. Zero-in
  Each time a model affected by this protocol makes a ranged attack against a target within 12", the hit roll
  gains Advantage.

  ### 2. Assist Reanimation
  Each time a unit affected by this protocol unit uses its **Reanimation Protocols** special rule, you may re-roll up to
  2 of the dice (for Reactivation and/or Reassembly).

  ### 3. Calculate Weakpoint
  Each time a model affected by this protocol makes a melee attack while not being in Defensive stance, the wound roll
  gains Advantage.

  ### 4. Calibrate
  As soon as a unit is affected by this protocol, it starts calibrating, unless it already finished calibrating in one 
  of the previous turns. While a unit is calibrating, its Melee Skill and Ballistic Skill characteristics are reduced to
  2 (unless they would otherwise be lower). Calibration finishes at the end of the current battle round, and from that
  point on (for the remainder of the battle), whenever a model from the calibrated unit makes a hit roll or a wound roll
  for a melee or ranged attack against an enemy unit, a 'tens' roll of 1 may be re-rolled. A single unit can re-roll 
  only 1 die per phase using this effect.
  
  This protocols always affects all units with the **Command Protocols** special rule, even while they are In Disarray.
  
  ### 5. Coalesce
  Each time a unit affected by this protocol unit uses its **Living Metal** special rule, each model in this unit regains
  1 additional lost wound. At the start of Morale phase, each unit affected by this protocol loses 1 Strain.

  This protocols always affects all units with the **Command Protocols** special rule, even while they are In Disarray.

  ### 6. Conceal
  Each time a ranged attack targets a unit affected by this protocol at a range greater than 12", the hit roll of that 
  attack gains an Impairment.

  ### 7. Concentrate Fire
  Each time a whole unit affected by this protocols declares all attacks against the same enemy unit when selected to
  shoot, wound rolls of all attacks that are made at a range of 12" or less gain Advantage.

  ### 8. Defend
  Enemy units that are within 1" of units affected by this protocol have their Attack characteristics reduced by 1, down to a
  minimum of 1.  

  ### 9. Enhance Multitasking
  Models affected by this protcol gain Advantage to all hit rolls for attacks made with Pistol-type weapons, and
  never count as being Flat-Footed in the Fight phase.

  ### 10. Fend Off
  When a unit affected by this protocols performs "Prepare to Repel" in the Charge phase, all models in it gain +1 Attack
  until the end of the following Fight phase.

  ### 11. Flash-blitz
  Each time a model affected by this protocol makes a melee attack while not being in Defensive stance, the hit roll
  gains Advantage.

  ### 12. Flush Out
  Each time a model affected by this protocol makes a ranged attack against a target unit within 12", if that unit is
  Partially Obscured, make attacks as if it were Completely Visible, and if it is Heavily Obscured, make attacks as if
  it is Partially Obscured.

  ### 13. Lock Down
  Units affected by this protocol gain the **Objective Secured** special rule. If a model in such a unit already has this
  ability, that model counts as one additional model when determining control of an objective marker.
  
  ### 14. Overcharge Servos
  Add 1" to the Move and Charge Bonus characteristics of units affected by this protocol.

  ### 15. Overpower
  Each time a model affected by this protocol makes a melee attack while being in Aggressive stance, if its unit charged
  this turn, the Strength of the attack is improved by 1.
  
  ### 16. Reinforce
  Units affected by this protocol gain +1 to their Exhaustion rolls after arriving as Reinforcements.

  ### 17. Sunder
  Each time a model affected by this protocol makes an attack, after the wound roll is made, if the attack would be resolved
  with AP 0, it's resolved with AP -1 instead.
  
  ### 18. Snipe
  Each time a model affected by this protocol makes a ranged attack with a Rapid Fire, Steady or Heavy weapon at a range
  greater than 24", the target cannot make Cover saves against this attack.
  
  Note: When attacking a multi-model unit, or a model with a hull, the range of the attack is always the shortest
  possile range - to the closest visible model/closest visible part of the hull.
  
  ### 19. Press On
  Each time a unit affected by this protocol performs the Snap Shooting action, it may use any Rapid Fire weapons it is
  equipped with as if it were performing the Full Shooting action instead.

  ### 20. Shield
  Each time a model affected by this protocol would lose a wound, roll a D6. On a roll of 6, the wound is not lost.
  
## Warlord Traits

  ### 1. Veteran of a Thousand Millenia
  Increase this WARLORD's Ballistic Skill by 1 (to a maximum of 9) and Melee Skill by 1 (to a maximum of 10). 
  During each Fight phase, he may select 2 different Stances to fight in.
  
  ### 2. Unnerving Presence (Aura)
  Whenever an enemy unit needs to use its Nerve score to resolve another rule (for example, a Morale test), if
  it is within 6" of this WARLORD, reduce its Nerve score by D3. This reduction lasts until the end of the phase
  and a single unit can only be affected by this effect once per phase.
  
  ### 3. Envoy of the Silent King
  This WARLORD gains the 'NOBLE' keyword and its Nerve characteristic is increased by 1. In addition, one model in the
  army can take a Relic for free.
  
  ### 4. Short-circuit Tactician
  During your Command phase, if this WARLORD is on the battlefield, and if in the previous battle round you chose
  not to enact any Command Protocol, then in this Command phase you may choose to enact 2 (different) Command Protocols
  at the same time.
  
  ### 5. I'll Be Back
  Once per battle, this WARLORD's reanimation attempt (which means Rectivation roll + Reassembly roll) can succeed
  automatically (player's choice as to when to use this, but it must be before any Reanimation rolls).
  After this effect is used, the WARLORD is incapacitated until the same phase of the next turn.

  ### 6. Body Made of Old Nokias
  Whenever an attack is made against this WARLORD, the wound roll gains an Impairment. (name = TODO)

  ### 7. Eroded Mind
  _MaÅ¡ina za mlevenje mesa._

  TODO

  ### 8. Logistics Optimizer
  If this WARLORD is on the battlefield (or in Reserves if it is the 1st or 2nd battle round), after you use a 
  Stratagem, roll a D6. On a 5+, gain 1 CP.
  
  ### IDEAS:
  - Roll to-wound against N instead of T
  - Nearby gauss weapons always gain bonus AP as if a 66 was rolled to wound
  - The Collector - army gains +2 Relics
  - Trade Initiative for Attacks
  - If the warlord would attack first... ?

## Relics

  ### Trinary Orb

  the same way, except that it can be used twice per battle, instead of once.

  friendly \<DYNASTY\> CORE unit within 3" of the bearer can be removed from the battlefield and immediately set up 
  back on the battlefield anywhere that is more than 8" away from enemy models. The bearer must be set up within 3" of 
  the other unit and that unit must be set up wholly within 6" of the bearer.

  longer considered to be healed by it).

  ### 13. Disruption Fields (1CP)

  ### 14. Malevolent Arcing (1CP)
  Use this Stratagem in your Shooting phase, when a NECRONS unit from your army is selected to shoot. Until the end of
  the phase, each time a model in that unit makes an attack with a **Tesla Weapon** if a hit roll of 61 or more is
  rolled: 2 hits are scored against another enemy unit (of your choice) that's within 6" of the original target, in
  addition to the usual effect of **Tesla Weapon**. This other enemy unit must be visible to the original target, but
  doesn't have to be visible to the shooting unit.

## Unit Datasheets

### \[Philosophy] Nerve scores
No units in this codex will have a Nerve score dependant on the number of models remaining in the unit - that's one
of their "special things".
- Canoptek - 9
- "Regular" Necrons - 10
- HQ - 11
- Top-end HQs - 12
- DESTROYER CULT units get -1 to the above rules because they are crazy

### \[Philosophy] Initiative scores
- Baseline is 2. They are indifferent zombie robots. This applies to "regular" necrons.
- Canopteks have baseline 3 because they are not zombified and not so indifferent.
- Close combat units get +1 because they are specialised for it.
- Some Elites can get a further +1 for being so elite.
- HQs get +1.
- DESTROYER CULT units get +1 to the above rules because they are, as previously stated, crazed.
