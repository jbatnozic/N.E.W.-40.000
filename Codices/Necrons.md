# Codex: Necrons

## Codex Special Rules

  ### Reanimation Protocols:
  At the start of each of Remove Casualties step, this unit's Reanimation Protocols are enacted if the unit suffered any
  casualties since the last time they were enacted.

  When a unit's Reanimation Protocols are enacted, each model in it that would now be removed from the battlefield as a
  casualty has a chance to Reanimate itself and return to battle. This is done in two steps:
  1. **Reactivation:** Roll a D6 for the model (this is a "Reactivation roll").
  On a 5+, the model is Reactivated - proceed to step 2. Otherwise, the model fails to Reanimate.
  2. **Reassembly:** Roll another D6 for the model (this is a "Reassembly roll"). If the result of the roll is higher than
  the model's Wounds characteristic, or in an unmodified 6, the model is successfully Reassembled and Reanimated. Otherwise,
  the model fails to Reanimate.

  Models that are successfully Reanimated are NOT removed during this Remove Casualties step, regain all lost wounds and 
  no longer count as having been destroyed or otherwise made a casualty. All the rest are removed as normal.
  
  Both Reactivation and Reassembly rolls are considered Reanimation Protocol rolls for purposes of other rules.
  
  Each time a unit's Reanimation Protocols are enacted, you can make rolls for all models with the same Wounds characteristic
  all at once, instead of individually, and determine after rolling which model each success (after both rolls) applies to.
  
  In addition, each time a unit's Reanimation Protocols are enacted, if ALL the models in it have been destroyed (that is, 
  the whole unit will be removed if all Reanimation Protocol rolls fail), this is considered a "Critical Reanimation".
  During a Critical Reanimation, all Reanimation Protocol rolls suffer a -1 penalty.
  
  A single Reanimation Protocol roll cannot be modified by more than +1 or -1 after all the modifiers are totalled.
  
  ### Command Protocols:
  (TODO)
  
  ### Cold Hard Logic:
  This unit ignores the effects of "Panicking" and is never considered to have this status. However, if this unit would receive
  this status as a result of a failed Morale test, do the following:
   - If more than half (rounded down) of its starting number of models are still present on the battlefield (even if they were destroyed but haven't yet been removed as casualties), nothing happens.
   - Otherwise, the units phases out - remove it from the battlefield at the end of the current battle phase (it counts as destroyed but this doesn't cause strain to nearby friendly units).
  
  _Example: A unit of Necron Warriors, which counted 10 models at the start of the game, takes a Morale test and fails with a
  large enough margin to warrant gaining the Panicking status. If at least 6 models are still present, the unit simply ignores
  this status. But if only 5 or fewer models are present, it will phase out at the end of the battle phase. If the unit had 
  originally counted 15 models, it would need more than 7 (so at least 8) models in order to not phase out._
  
  ### Living Metal:
  At the start of your Command phase, each model in this unit regains 1 lost wound.
  
  ### Hardwired for Destruction:
  When rolling to hit for an attack made by this unit, you may re-roll a 'tens' roll of 1.
  TODO: Fearless, but...?
  
  ### Dimensional Translocation:
  \[Same as Deep Strike]

  ---
  
  ### \[Philosophy] Keyword and Special Rule allocation:
  
  **CORE:** "Normal" (and mostly humanoid) Necrons, such as Lords, Overlords, Warriors, Immortals etc. will get CORE. Probably Destroyers too, even if they are a little bit insane and not so humanoid anymore. CANOPTEK things and especially large monsters will NOT be CORE.

  **Standard Core traits:** All "Normal" Necrons, i.e. those that get CORE, will all have the following special rules: **Reanimation Protocols**, **Command Protocols**, **Living Metal** and **Cold Hard Logic**.
  - Exception: DESTROYER CULT units will not get **Cold Hard Logic** (because they are insane) but they will get **Hardwired for Destruction**.
    
  **Standard Canoptek traits:** All CANOPTEK units will have the following special rules: **Command Protocols**, **Living Metal** and **Fearless**.
  
  For other units (which there aren't so many of) special rules will be determined on a case-by-case basis.

  (we like to shoot)

Advances, you may choose to have it Translocate - if it does, models in it can move horizontally through terrain and
other models when resolving this Advance move, but the unit will not be eligible to perform any actions in the following

  ### IDEAS
  - In the Fight phase, during Initiative step 1, if this unit is in Enagagement Range of enemy units, each model in it can make 1 additional attack with any weapon it is equipped with.
  - (Rad-wreathed) -1 S aura, bonus to particle weapons
  - Turn AP -1 into AP -2 in melee
  - Chance for +1 D when shooting
  - +1 to Reassembly rolls and can stack up to +2

## Command Protocols

  ### 3. Augment Precision
  Each time a model affected by this protocol makes a melee attack while not being in Defensive stance, the hit roll
  gains Advantage.

  ### 4. Calibrate
  TODO
  
  ### 5. Coalesce
  Each time a unit affected by this protocol unit uses its **Living Metal** special rule, each model in this unit regains
  1 additional lost wound. At the start of Morale phase, each unit affected by this protocol loses 1 Strain.

  ### 6. Conceal
  Each time a ranged attack targets a unit affected by this protocol at a range greater than 12", the hit roll of that attack
  gains an Impairment.

  ### 7. Concentrate Fire

  shoot, hit rolls of all attacks that are made at a range of 12" or less gain Advantage.

  Enemy units that are within 1" of units affected by this protocol have their Attack characteristics reduced by 1, down to a
  minimum of 1.  

  ### 9. Disable Force Limiters

  until the end of the following Fight phase.

  Each time a model affected by this protocol makes a ranged attack against a target within 12", the target receives no
  benefit of cover.

  ### 13. Lock Down

## Weapons

### Qualities

**Gauss Weapon:** This weapon ignores the Puny Force rule. Each time an attack is made with this weapon, wound rolls of 61 or
more always successfully wound the target. A wound roll of 61 or more that would successfully wound the target anyway is instead
resolved with Armour Penetration increased by 1.

**Tesla Weapon:** Each time an attack is made with this weapon, an unmodified hit roll of 61 or more scores 2 additional hits.

**Particle Weapon:** When this weapon targets a unit within half range, or the bearer hasn't moved in the previous Movement phase,
double the number of shots the weapon makes.

## Unit Datasheets

### \[Philosophy] Nerve scores
No units in this codex will have a Nerve score dependant on the number of models remaining in the unit - that's one
of their "special things".
- Canoptek - 9
- "Regular" Necrons - 10
- HQ - 11
- Top-end HQs - 12
- DESTROYER CULT units get -1 to the above rules because they are crazy

### \[Philosophy] Initiative scores
- Baseline is 2. They are indifferent zombie robots. This applies to "regular" necrons.
- Canopteks have baseline 3 because they are not zombified and not so indifferent.
- Close combat units get +1 because they are specialised for it.
- Some Elites can get a further +1 for being so elite.
- HQs get +1.
- DESTROYER CULT units get +1 to the above rules because they are, as previously stated, crazed.
