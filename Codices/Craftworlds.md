# Codex: Craftworlds


## Codex Special Rules

  ### Battle Focus:
  A unit with Battle Focus can fire Assault-type and Pistol-type ranged weapons during the Snap Shooting
  action even after Advancing and without suffering an Impairment to the relevant hit rolls. This is a
  Command Effect.
  
  ### Wraith Construct:
  _Wraith Constructs are not living creatures and are therefore not affected by emotions such as dread and
  urges of self-preservation. However, they do not see the world as mortals do, but instead witness an 
  ever-shifting image of spirits that makes them slower to react to the changes on the battlefield. For that
  reason, these spirit warriors are often accompanied by psykers who guide them through the lands of the
  living._
  
  Each Wraith Construct has the WRAITH CONSTRUCT keyword and the following special rules:
  - **Fearless**
  - **Wraithsight:** While a Wraith Construct unit is not within 6" of a friendly PSYKER model (except those that are In Disarray
or Panicking), its Melee Skill (MS) and Ballistic Skill (BS) characteristics are reduced by 1.
  - **Spirit Guide:** If a Wraith Construct unit is within 3" of a SPIRITSEER model (except those that are In Disarray
or Panicking), they can be affected by friendly Psychic powers from the Runes of Battle discipline as if they had the CORE keyword.

  - When a friendly unit within 12" of the caster would make a Saving throw or a Deny the Witch roll, you can use the Clairvoyance die instead of rolling.
  - When a friendly unit within 12" of the caster would make a Psychic test, you can use the Clairvoyance die instead of one of the dice that would be rolled.
