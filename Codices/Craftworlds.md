# Codex: Craftworlds


## Codex Special Rules

  ### Battle Focus:
  A unit with Battle Focus can fire Assault-type and Pistol-type ranged weapons during the Snap Shooting
  action even after Advancing and without suffering an Impairment to the relevant hit rolls. This is a
  Command Effect.
  
  ### Wraith Construct:
  _Wraith Constructs are not living creatures and are therefore not affected by emotions such as dread and
  urges of self-preservation. However, they do not see the world as mortals do, but instead witness an 
  ever-shifting image of spirits that makes them slower to react to the changes on the battlefield. For that
  reason, these spirit warriors are often accompanied by psykers who guide them through the lands of the
  living._
  
  Each Wraith Construct has the WRAITH CONSTRUCT keyword and the following special rules:
  - **Fearless**
  - **Wraithsight:** While a Wraith Construct unit is not within 6" of a friendly PSYKER model (except those that are In Disarray
or Panicking), its Melee Skill (MS) and Ballistic Skill (BS) characteristics are reduced by 1.
  - **Spirit Guide:** If a Wraith Construct unit is within 3" of a SPIRITSEER model (except those that are In Disarray
or Panicking), they can be affected by friendly Psychic powers from the Runes of Battle discipline as if they had the CORE keyword.

  ### Clairvoyance Dice:
  Certain rules in the codex will allow units to gain Clairvoyance dice. When a unit gains a Clairvoyance die, roll a D6 and place
  it next to that unit. These dice can be used until the end of the battle round in one of the following ways:
  - When that unit would make a Hit or a Wound D66 roll, you can use the Clairvoyance die as both the 'tens' roll and the 'ones' roll.
  - When that unit would make a Damage roll, you can instead use the Clairvoyance die. If that Damage roll is something other than a D6 (for example, a D3 roll), read the value on the Clairvoyance die accordingly.
  - When that unit would make a Saving throw or a Deny the Witch roll, you can use the Clairvoyance die instead.
  - When that unit would make a Psychic test, you can use the Clairvoyance die instead of one of the dice that would be rolled.
  - When that unit would make a Charge roll, you can use the result on the Clairvoyance die instead of the usual 2D3 roll to determine charge distance.
  Clairvoyance dice must be substituted for any of these rolls before these rolls are made.
