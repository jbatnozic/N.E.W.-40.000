# Codex: Craftworlds

## Codex Special Rules

  ### Battle Focus:
  A unit with Battle Focus can fire Assault-type and Pistol-type ranged weapons during the Snap Shooting
  action even after Advancing and without suffering an Impairment to the relevant hit rolls. This is a
  Command Effect.
  
  ### Wraith Construct:
  _Wraith Constructs are not living creatures and are therefore not affected by emotions such as dread and
  urges of self-preservation. However, they do not see the world as mortals do, but instead witness an 
  ever-shifting image of spirits that makes them slower to react to the changes on the battlefield. For that
  reason, these spirit warriors are often accompanied by psykers who guide them through the lands of the
  living._
  
  Each Wraith Construct has the WRAITH CONSTRUCT keyword and the following special rules:
  - **Fearless**
  - **Wraithsight:** While a Wraith Construct unit is not within 6" of a friendly PSYKER model (except those that are In
Disarray), its Melee Skill (MS) and Ballistic Skill (BS) characteristics are reduced by 2.
  - **Spirit Guide:** If a Wraith Construct unit is within 3" of a SPIRITSEER model (except those that are In Disarray),
they can be affected by friendly Psychic powers from the Runes of Battle discipline as if they had the CORE keyword.

  ### Clairvoyance Dice:
  Certain rules in the codex will allow units to gain Clairvoyance dice. When a unit gains a Clairvoyance die, roll a D6 and place
  it next to that unit. These dice can be used until the end of the battle round in one of the following ways:
  - When that unit would make a Hit or a Wound D66 roll, you can use the Clairvoyance die as both the 'tens' roll and the 'ones' roll.
  - When that unit would make a Damage roll, you can instead use the Clairvoyance die. If that Damage roll is something other than a D6 (for example, a D3 roll), read the value on the Clairvoyance die accordingly.
  - When that unit would make a Saving throw or a Deny the Witch roll, you can use the Clairvoyance die instead.
  - When that unit would make a Psychic test, you can use the Clairvoyance die instead of one of the dice that would be rolled.
  - When that unit would make a Charge roll, you can use the result on the Clairvoyance die instead of the usual 2D3 roll to determine charge distance.

  Clairvoyance dice must be substituted for any of these rolls before these rolls are made.
  
  ### The Path of Command:
  While this unit is not In Disarray, whenever a friendly \<CRAFTWORLD\> CORE unit within 6" that is also not In 
  Disarray makes a hit roll for an attack, you may re-roll a 'tens' roll of 1.

  ### Spirit Stones
  If this model would lose a wound, roll a D6. On a roll of 6, the wound is not lost.

  ### Vectored Engines
  If this unit Advances, then until the end of the battle round, hit rolls of all ranged attacks targeting this unit
  suffer an Impairment.

## Craftworlds

  If your army includes any ASURYANI units, select which Craftworld they are from. Their \<CRAFTWORLD\> keyword is
  replaced with the appropriate name (ALAITOC for Alaitoc, ULTHWE for Ulthwe - you get the idea). Each of these units
  gains the Craftworld-specific ability as a special rule. The Craftworld-specific Stratagem, Relic and Warlord Trait
  are also unlocked for your army to use.

  _(Napraviću eventualno da mogu da se mešaju različiti Craftworlds, nego već je petak...)_

  ### Alaitoc:
  - **\[Ability] Fieldcraft:** While a model in this unit is more than 12" away from an enemy model, if it would be
considered Completely Visible from the point of view of that enemy model, it is considered Partially Obscured instead,
and if it would be considered Partially Obscured, it is considered Heavily Obscured instead. In addition, when this unit
moves through Difficult Ground, its movement is reduced by 1" instead of 2". Both of these effects are Command Effects.
  - **\[Stratagem] Ranger Ambush (1CP):** Use this Stratagem in your opponent's Reinforcements phase, after an enemy 
unit has been set up on the battlefield. Select one RANGERS unit from your army that is either on the battlefield or in
Reserves.
    - If that RANGERS unit is in Reserves, set it up on the battlefield using the **Deep Strike** special rule so that it's
within 18" of that unit.
    - That RANGERS unit can, at the end of the phase, perform the Normal Shooting or Snap Shooting action, as if
it were the Shooting phase, but until the end of the phase it can only target the enemy unit that was just set up on 
the battlefield (and only if that enemy unit is an eligible target for that attack).
  - **\[Relic] Shiftshroud of Alanssair:** Equip to an ALAITOC INFANTRY CHARACTER model. When an enemy unit that is more
than 12" away from this model makes a ranged attack against this model, if it sees this model as at least Partially
Obscured, and this model is not the closest visible enemy unit to it, make the hit rolls as if firing Overwatch.
  - **\[Warlord Trait] Master of Ambush:** This WARLORD gains the **Infiltrate** and **Scout** special rules. In
addition, other \<CRAFTWORLD> CORE units within 6" of this WARLORD gain the **Scout** special rule.
  
  **SPECIAL:** ALAITOC RANGERS units of no more than 5 models can be upgraded to Pathfinders (+4 pts per model). If
  upgraded, they gain +1 to their Move, Ballistic Skill and Nerve characteristics.

  ### Biel-Tan:
  (indomitable spirit, shuriken upgrade; some Aspect Warriors -> troop)
  - **\[Ability] Swordwind:** Whenever this unit makes a ranged attack with a **Shuriken Weapon**, a hit roll of 61 or
more scores 1 additional hit (this additional hit is resolved with AP improved by 2 as well).
  - **\[Stratagem] Militant Heritage (1CP):** Use this Stratagem before the battle, when you are mustering your army. 
Select one BIEL-TAN FIRE DRAGONS, BIEL-TAN STRIKING SCORPIONS or BIEL-TAN SWOOPING HAWKS unit from your army. That unit
now takes up a Troop Battlefield Role slot, instead of Elite/Fast Attack, and gains the **Objective Secured** special rule.
  - **\[Relic] Spirit Stone of Anath'Lan:** Equip to a BIEL-TAN PSYKER CHARACTER model. You can re-roll any failed 
Psychic tests made by this model. However, should this result in a second failure, then this model is overwhelmed by 
waves of grief and cannot attempt to manifest any more psychic powers for the remainder of the phase.
  - **\[Warlord Trait] Defiant Leader:** Friendly BIEL-TAN units within 6" of this WARLORD do not gain Strain when a
friendly unit within 8" of them is removed from the battlefield (as a result of being destroyed).
  
  **SPECIAL:** Any BIEL-TAN ASPECT WARRIOR Exarch can be upgraded to an Exemplar. An Exemplar can have two different Exarch
  Powers, and you only pay points for the costlier of the two. No more than one Exemplar of each Aspect Warrior type can
  be included in an army (so: no more than 1 Dire Avenger Exemplar, no more than 1 Swooping Hawks Exemplar, and so on).
  
  ### Iyanden:
  - **\[Ability] Stoic Endurance:** Once per phase, you may re-roll an armour (but not a cover or invulnerable) saving
throw made for a model in this unit. In addition, if this unit has the CORE keyword, increase its Nerve characteristic 
by 1 (up to a maximum of 11).
  - **\[Stratagem] Ghost Batallion (1/2 CP):** Use this Stratagem before the battle, when you are mustering your army. Select
one IYANDEN WRAITHGUARD or IYANDEN WRAITHBLADES unit from your army. That unit now takes up a Troop Battlefield Role slot, 
instead of Elite, and gains the **Objective Secured** special rule. If this unit contains 5 models or less, this Stratagem
costs 1 CP. Otherwise, it costs 2 CP.
  - **\[Relic] Psytronome of Iyanden:** Equip to a IYANDEN PSYKER CHARACTER model. While this model is within 9" of a
friendly WRAITH CONSTRUCT unit, it is considered to be within 3" of that unit for the purposes of **Wraith Sight**
and **Spirit Guide** special rules. In addition, while a friendly WRAITH CONSTRUCT unit is within 9" of this model, that
unit may re-roll one hit roll per phase.
  - **\[Warlord Trait] Commander of the Dead:** If this WARLORD has the **The Path of Command** special rule, it can 
also affect \<CRAFTWORLD> WRAITH CONSTRUCT INFANTRY units (despite them not having the CORE keyword).

  **SPECIAL:** Stoic Endurance is not a Command Effect and stays active even while the unit is In Disarray.
  
  ### Saim-Hann:
  - **\[Ability] Wild Host:** After this unit makes a charge move, it gains a +1 bonus to its Attack characteristic in
the following Fight phase. In addition, if this unit is a BIKER, all models in this unit can treat all Heavy weapons 
they are equipped with as Assault weapons. Both of these effects are Command Effects.
  - **\[Stratagem] Name (1/2 CP):** Use this Stratagem before the battle, when you are mustering your army. 
Select one SAIM-HANN SHINING SPEARS or SAIM-HANN (?) unit from your army. That unit now takes up a Troop Battlefield 
Role slot, instead of Fast Attack, and gains the **Objective Secured** special rule. If this unit contains 5 models or
less, this Stratagem costs 1 CP. Otherwise, it costs 2 CP.
  - **\[Relic] Talisman of Tionchar:** Equip to a SAIM-HANN INFANTRY CHARACTER or SAIM-HANN BIKER CHARACTER. After this
model makes a charge move, its melee attacks gain +1 Strength, +1 Damage and AP improved by 1 in the following Fight 
phase.
  - **\[Warlord Trait] Wild Rider Chieftain:** When this WARLORD Disengages, if it has the BIKER keyword, it cannot be
Pursued except by an enemy unit with an equal or better Move characteristic.
  
  **SPECIAL:** A SAIM-HANN unit that has the **Aerobatic Grace** special rule can take a 6+ invulnerable save against
  melee attacks.

  ### Ulthwe:
  - **\[Ability] Foresight of the Damned:** At the start of your Command phase, if this unit is not In Disarray, it
gains 1 Clairvoyance die.
  - **\[Stratagem] Discipline of the Black Guardians (1CP):** Use this Stratagem when a unit of ULTHWE GUARDIANS is
selected to shoot, or when it is about to make its attacks in the Fight phase. Until the end of the phase, hit rolls of
all attacks made by this unit gain Advantage.
  - **\[Relic] Ghosthelm of Alishazier:** Equip to an ULTHWE PSYKER CHARACTER model. That model knows one additional
psychic power from the disciplines available to it, and can receive a +1 bonus to its psychic test once per Psychic phase.
  - **\[Warlord Trait] Fateweaver:** Whenever a friendly \<CRAFTWORLD\> unit within 8" of this WARLORD gains a
Clairvoyance Die, you can re-roll it.

  **SPECIAL:** When an ULTHWE PSYKER manifests the Clairvoyance psychic power, they gain an extra Clairvoyance Die.
  
  ### Black Library:
  - **\[Ability] Forbidden Knowledge:** If this unit is a PSYKER, before it attempts to manifest a psychic power, you
may choose to have it use forbidden knowledge. If you do, it gains +1 to Psychic tests, -1 to Ghosthelm rolls, and all
Psychic test results of 11 or higher result in Perils of the Warp. Enemies' Deny the Witch rolls of 6 must be re-rolled
when used against forbidden knowledge. This is a Command Effect.
  - **\[Stratagem] (none)**
  - **\[Relic] The Book of Mol'Kerian:** Equip to an ULTHWE PSYKER CHARACTER model. One per Psychic phase, this model
may attempt to manifest any psychic power known by another friendly ULTHWE PSYKER.
  - **\[Warlord Trait] I am the Black Librarians:** _Their essence is mine... Because I am the spirit of their 
existence... I am them... I am them... I am them..._ When this WARLORD attempts to manifest a psychic power that has 
already been manifested during this Psychic phase, use its original Warp Charge value increased by 1, no matter how many
times it has been attempted so far.
  
  **SPECIAL:** This Craftworld doesn't unlock a unique Stratagem, however, you can use the Webway Strike Stratagem any
  number of times per battle and it always costs 1 CP. In addition, each BLACK LIBRARY INFANTRY and BLACK LIBRARY BIKER
  unit gains this special rule: "**Webway Dwellers:** If this unit is set up on the battlefield using the 
  **Deep Strike** special rule, it gains a +1 bonus to its Exhaustion roll."

**KEYWORDS:** INFANTRY, CORE, DARK REAPERS

|-----------------------------------|-------|-----------|------|----|------|-----------

| Tempest launcher                  |  36"  | Heavy 2   |   5  | -2 |    1 | **Blast (Small).**

#### > SPECIAL RULES:
- **Battle Focus**
- **Exarch Guidance:** While this unit contains an Exarch, its Nerve characteristic is improved by 1.
- **Inescapable Accuracy:** Models in this unit can ignore 1 Impairment when making ranged attacks.

#### > OPTIONS:
- The Dark Reaper Exarch may replace their reaper launcher with a Shuriken cannon (free), 
Aeldari missile launcher (+10 pts) or Tempest launcher (+15 pts).
- The Dark Reaper Exarch can take one exarch power from the list below at the listed point cost.

#### > DARK REAPERS EXARCH POWERS:
- **Crack Shot (free):** Whenever this unit’s Dark Reaper Exarch makes a hit roll for a ranged attack, you may re-roll
a 'tens' roll of 1.
- **Rain of Death (5 pts):** When this unit’s Dark Reaper Exarch shoots with a Tempest launcher, you can treat it as a 
Heavy 1 weapon with the Blast (Large) quality istead of Blast (Small). If you do, add +3 when rolling to determine if a 
Direct Hit is scored.
- **Rapid Shot (10 pts):** When this unit’s Dark Reaper Exarch shoots, add 1 to the number of attacks made with that 
model’s ranged weapon (for example, he would treat Heavy 2 as Heavy 3).
- **Long-ranged Fire (10 pts):** Whilst this unit contains a Dark Reaper Exarch, add 6" to the Range characteristic of 
ranged weapons models in this unit are equipped with.
- **Grim Visage (15 pts):** One per phase, when an enemy unit suffers a casualty as a result of an attack made by this 
unit while it contains a Dark Reaper Exarch, you can roll a die. On a 1-3, that enemy unit gains 1 strain. On a 4-6, it 
gains 2 strain.
- **Aggressive Tactics (15 pts):** A unit where the Exarch has this power loses Inescapable Accuracy, and the Range 
characteristics of all weapons used by that unit are halved - these effects persist even if the Exarch is destroyed or 
while the unit is In Disarray. While the unit contains a Dark Reaper Exarch, models in the unit may treat Heavy weapons 
as Rapid Fire weapons when shooting, and they gain +1 Attack (the bonus Attack is for the models, not for the ranged 
weapons). If a Dark Reaper Exarch/Exemplar has this power, they cannot have another Exarch power by any means.
- **Focused Fire: (20 pts):** When this unit is selected to shoot, if it contains a Dark Reaper Exarch, and if all
models are targeting the same enemy unit, add 1 to the Ballistic Skill of this unit until the end of the action. 
(Blast (\*) weapons are considered to be targeting a unit if the centre of the blast template intersects at least one 
model from that unit).

As with all exarch powers, Dark Reaper Exarch powers are NOT in effect while the unit is In Disarray. The exception is
Aggressive Tactics, as noted in the power's description.
