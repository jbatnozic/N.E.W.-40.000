# Codex: Orks

## Codex Special Rules

  ### 'Ere We Go:
  While this unit is not In Disarray:
  - When making a charge roll for this unit, you can re-roll any number of dice;
  - During the Fight phase, increase the Initiative characteristics of models in this unit by 1 if the unit made a charge
    move during the previous Charge phase.

  ### Breakin' 'Eads:
  **Note:** This special rule can be conferred to a unit by a model in that unit and/or by a nearby CHARACTER.

  When testing Morale for this unit, then after determining the result of the test (which is most commonly
  2D6 + current Strain), but before determining the consequence of the test, you may roll up to 3 six-sided dice (but
  no more than the number of models currently in the unit, excluding the one conferring this special rule). For each
  die rolled, add 1 to the Nerve characteristic of this unit for the duration of this Morale test only, but then after 
  determining the consequence of the test, the unit suffers a mortal wound for each 1 or 2 rolled.

  ### WAAAGH!
  If your WARLORD is a WARBOSS, then once per battle, in your Command phase, you can call a Waaagh!. To do so, that 
  WARBOSS must be on the battlefield or embarked on a TRANSPORT that is on the battlefield.

  A Waaagh! has two stages. The first stage is active from when the Waaagh! is called, and lasts until the start of your
  next Command phase. When the first stage ends, the second stage starts, and lasts until the start of your subsequent
  Command phase. After this point, the Waaagh! is no longer active, and has no further effect.

  **Stage 1: Call Da Waaagh!**
  - If an ORKS CORE or ORKS CHARACTER unit from your army makes an Advance move this turn, unexhaust it immediately
    afterwards. It does NOT count as having Advanced during this turn (but does count as having moved normally).
  - Add 1 to the Strength and Attacks characteristics of ORKS models from your army.

  **Stage 2: Get Stuck In!**
  - Add 1 to the Strength and Attacks characteristics of ORKS models from your army.

## \[Philorksophy] Ork Morale

Ork units have relatively low Nerve scores, mostly not surpassing 7 or 8 even at maximum unit sizes. They make up for it
with **Mob Rule** and various Bosses providing **Breakin' 'Eads**.

Rule of thumb:
- Boyz and Boyz-like units: up to 7 (drop per 10 models lost)
- Elites: up to 7 (lower drops)
- Characters and vehicles: usually 8
- Warbosses: 9

Some units can take a bosspole (usually 15 pts) for another +1N.

### Effects of 'In Disarray':
Units that are In Disarray don't benefit from: **'Ere We Go**, their klan Kultur (unless otherwise noted), and if a
Waaagh! is declared, there's a chance they won't be affected by it.

### Effects of 'Panicking':
As usual, a Panicking unit is nigh useless. In addition, Panicking units are never affected by a Waaagh! (unless noted
otherwise).

---

## Ork Clans (or Klans? idk)

If your army includes any ORKS units, select which Clan they are from. 
Then for each unit with the \<CLAN\> keyword:
- Replace this keyword with the appropriate name (BAD MOONS for Bad Moons, GOFFS for Goffs - you get the idea).
- Each of these units gains the Clan-specific 'Kultur' as a special rule that it can benefit from while it is not
  In Disarray (unless noted otherwise).

The Clan-specific Stratagem, Relic and Warlord Trait are also unlocked for your army to use.

  ### Bad Moons
  - **\[Kultur] - Armed To Da Teef:** TODO (+6" range except for flamers and psychic powers. 61+ to wound = +1AP)
  - **\[Stratagem] - ??? (?CP):** TODO (pregame permanent buff to a vehicle; +1T and re-roll hit rolls of 1x)
  - **\[Relic] - Da Best Armour Teef Can Buy:** TODO (4+ invul, sth else...)
  - **\[Warlord Trait] - Obsessive Showoff:** _This rich warlord has a compulsion to own the newest, shiniest and
    killiest weapons he can get his hands on, and he even hands them out to his favourite lads to demonstrate his
    obsecene wealth._ At the start of the Shooting phase, select a BAD MOONS unit within 6" of this WARLORD, if
    possible. Until the end of the battle round, each time this WARLORD or a model from the selected unit (if any)
    makes a ranged attack with a weapon that has the **Dakka! Dakka! Dakka!** quality, this quality triggers on hit
    rolls of 51+ (instead of 61+).
  - **\[Waaagh! Modifier] - Name:** TODO (improve BS by 1?)

  ### Blood Axes
  - **\[Kultur] - Name:** (infantry except mega is always shrouded unless a waaagh is active + sth else)
  - **\[Stratagem] - Ded Sneaky (1CP):** Use this Stratagem at the end of your Movement phase. Select one BLOOD AXES
    INFANTRY unit from your army (excluding MEGA ARMOUR units) that is within 3" of any battlefield edge. Remove that
    unit from the battlefield and place it in the reserves.
  - **\[Relic] - Morgog's Finkin' Cap:** TODO
  - **\[Warlord Trait] - Name:** TODO
  - **\[Waaagh! Modifier] - Name:** TODO

  ### Deathskulls
  - **\[Kultur] - Lucky Blue Gitz:**
    - One per phase, you may re-roll 1 hit roll, 1 wound roll and 1 saving throw made by or for a model in this unit.
    - If this unit has the INFANTRY keyword, it gains the **Objective Secured** special rule unless a Waaagh! is
      currently active.
  - **\[Stratagem] - Wreckaz (2CP):** Use this Stratagem at the start of any phase. Select 1 enemy VEHICLE that is
    within 12" of any DEATHSKULL unit from your army. Until the end of the phase, wound rolls of all attacks made
    against the selected VEHICLE gain an Advantage. If this vehicle is destroyed by the end of the phase, gain 1CP.
  - **\[Relic] - New Blue Toy:** _After this relic was 'acquired' from another clan, it was promptly painted blue to
    cover up any marks of previous ownership._ This relic can be any one relic otherwise reserved for use by another clan.
  - **\[Warlord Trait] - Opportunist:**
    - Each time you select a target for this Warlord, if you select a CHARACTER unit within 12", you can ignore the
      "Look Out, Sir!" rule.
    - Each time an enemy unit (except BEAST and SWARM units) is destroyed within 6" of this warlord, improve his
      Armour Save (Sv) chartacteristic by 1 (cannot be improved past 2+).
  - **\[Waaagh! Modifier] - Good Omen:** While the Waaagh! is active, DEATHSKULLS units from your army can use their
    **Lucky Blue Gitz** re-roll ability twice per phase (instead of once).

  ### Freebooterz
  - **\[Kultur] - Name:** TODO
  - **\[Stratagem] - Get Da Loot:** TODO (ObSec to INFANTRY unit for 1 turn)

  - **\[Warlord Trait] - Name:** TODO
  - **\[Waaagh! Modifier] - Name:** TODO
  
  ### Goffs
  - **\[Kultur] - No Mukkin' About:** Each time a model with this kultur makes a melee attack, an hit roll of 61 or
  more scores 1 additional hit.
  - **\[Stratagem] - Unbridled Carnage (2CP):** Use this Stratagem in the Fight phase when a GOFF CORE or GOFF CHARACTER
  unit from your army that has the "No Mukkin’ About" Clan Kultur is selected to fight. Until the end of the phase, each
  time a model in that unit makes an attack, it scores an additional hit on an unmodified hit roll of 51+ instead of 61+.
  - **\[Warlord Trait] - Proper Killy:**
    - Add 1 to this WARLORD’s Attacks characteristic.
    - Each time this WARLORD makes a melee attack, improve the Armour Penetration characteristic of that attack by 1.
  - **\[Relic] - Name:** TODO
  - **\[Waaagh! Modifier] - Biggest n' Meanest:** During both stages of the Waaagh!, add 1 to the Toughness characteristic
  of GOFFS INFANTRY and GOFFS BIKER units from your army (except GRETCHIN units).

## Psychic Discipline - Power of the Waaagh!

  When a PSYKER from your army manifests a psychic power from this discipline, replace all instances of the \<CLAN\>
  keyword on that psychic power (if any) with the name of the clan that the PSYKER is from.

  ### 1. 'Eadbanger (Warp Charge: 5)
  _The energies raging through the Weirdboy go out of control, causing the heads of those nearby to explode._

  If manifested, place a large blast template centred over the caster. For every model intersecting the template
  (excluding the caster, and also VEHICLE and TITANIC models), roll a D6. On a 5+, that model's unit suffers 1
  mortal wound. You can re-roll the dice rolled against friendly ORKS models.

  ### 2. Zzap (Warp Charge: TODO)
  // simple ranged attack
  TODO

  ### 3. Jabbin' Fingerz (Warp Charge: 6)
  _The Weirdboy focuses his attention on a nearby enemy before jabbing his fingers into his own eyes. The unfortunate
  foe experiences an agonising pain before finding themselves temporarily blinded._

  If manifested, select one enemy unit that is within 18" of the caster and visible to them. Until the end of the battle
  round, each time a model in that unit makes an attack, the hit roll gains an Impairment.

  ### 4. Warpath (Warp Charge: 6)
  _The Weirdboy disperses the Waaagh! energy coursing through his frame into the Ork warriors around him, stoking their
  already bellicose nature to a roaring fever pitch._

  If manifested, select a friendly \<CLAN\> CORE and/or a CLAN CHARACTER unit (if selecting both, they must be within
  2" of each other). The selected unit(s) must be within 18" of the caster. Until the end of the battle round, add 1 to
  the Attacks characteristic of models in the selected unit(s).

  ### 5. Da Jump (Warp Charge: 7)
  _The Weirdboy closes his eyes tight and, in a storm of flashing green light, teleports a mass of confused greenskins
  to another part of the battlefield._

  If manifested, select a friendly \<CLAN\> CORE and/or a CLAN CHARACTER unit (if selecting both, they must be within
  2" of each other). At least 1 of the selected units must be within 2" of the caster. Alternatively, if there are no
  eligible units to select, skip it and proceed with the effect. Either way, remove the selected units (if any) and the
  caster from the battlefield, and set them up together, using the Deep Strike rules, as if it were the Reinforcements
  phase. Do not make an Exhaustion roll.

  When manifested, if the caster or any of the selected units are in Enagagement range of enemy models, the power has
  no effect unless the result of the Psychic test was 10 or higher.

  ### 6. Waaagh! (Warp Charge: 11)
  _The Weirdboy screams a warcry at the top of his lungs, suffusing his comrades with primal power._

  If manifested, and a Waaagh! WAS NOT declared during this battle round:
  - TODO

  If manifested, and a Waaagh! WAS declared during this battle round:
  - _Da Krunch!_

  ### Special Rule - Warphead:
  Some ORK PSYKERS may have the **Warphead** special rule. Its effects are as folows:
  - A Warphead never knows any Psychic powers (not even Smite, Psychic Bolt and Psychic Storm). Whenever a Warphead is
    selected during the Psychic phase to manifest a Psychic power, roll a D6. He must then attempt to manifest a Psychic
    power from the "Power of the Waaagh!" discipline corresponding to the result.
  - A Warphead always manifests Psychic powers at their original Warp Charge value, even if another PSYKER already
    attempted to manifest the same power during the same battle round. The Warp Charge value of the "Waaagh!" power for
    a Warphead is reduced to 8.
  - Add 1 to all Psychic test results rolled for a Warphead.

## Warlord Traits

  ### 1. 'Ard As Nails
  (defensive buff)
  
  ### 2. Big Gob
  Add 6" to the range of this WARLORD’s aura abilities (to a maximum of 12").
  
  ### 3. Follow Me Ladz!
  (sth when he charges together with a friendly unit)
  
  ### 4. Brutal But Kunnin'
  At the start of the Fight phase, roll a D6 and add the result to either this WARLORD's Weapon Skill characteristic
  or his Initiative characteristic. Then flip the die upside-down and add the result to his characteristic that you
  did not pick in the first step. (WS goes up to 9 and I goes up to 10.)
  
  **Note:** This assumes you're using standard dice where the opposite sides always add up to 7.
  
  ### 5. Kunnin' But Brutal
  After this WARLORD fights (make attack for each failed attack if targetting just 1 enemy unit)

  ### 6. Sadistic Butcher
  _This warlord dispenses gruesome death and dismemberment while fixing the victim's comrades with a maniacal gaze._
  
  Each time a model is destroyed as a result of a melee attack by this WARLORD, add 1 Strain to that model's unit.

  ### 7. Precizhun!
  This WARLORD's Ballistic Skill characteristic is increased by 2. In addition, whenever he makes an attack, a hit
  roll of 16 or less can be re-rolled.

  ### 8. Weirdest Lad In Da Land
  If this WARBOSS successfully manifests a psychic power, then until the end of the battle round, each time this
  warlord makes a melee attack, if a successful hit roll of 41 or more is rolled, the target suffers D3 mortal wounds
  and the attack sequence ends.

## Relics

  ### Buzzgob's Shoota
  
  ### Da Killa Klaw

  ### Orks Is Never Beaten (2CP)
  Use this Stratagem in the Fight phase, when an ORKS CHARACTER model in your army that has not already had a chance to
  fight this phase is destroyed. During the appropriate initiative step, this model can make melee attacks despite it
  already being a casualty. If the selected model’s characteristics change as it takes damage, use the bottom row of
  that model’s profile when resolving those attacks.

  ### Tide of Muscle (1CP)
  // ignore charge modifier

  // vehicle auto explode

  ### Careen! (1CP)

## Weapons

### Qualities

**Dakka! Dakka! Dakka!:** Each time you roll a hit roll of 61 or more for a ranged attack made with this weapon,
immediately make an additional hit roll against the same target using the same weapon. These additional hit rolls _can_
themselves generate further hit rolls using this rule. When firing a weapon with randomly determined characteristics 
(e.g. a Bubblechukka), any additional hit rolls use the same characteristics as the hit roll that generated the
additional hit roll. This ability does not affect weapons that automatically hit their target.
