### Qualities

**Dakka! Dakka! Dakka!:** Each time you roll a hit roll of 61 or more for a ranged attack made with this weapon,
immediately make an additional hit roll against the same target using the same weapon. These additional hit rolls _can_
themselves generate further hit rolls using this rule. When firing a weapon with randomly determined characteristics 
(e.g. a Bubblechukka), any additional hit rolls use the same characteristics as the hit roll that generated the
additional hit roll. This ability does not affect weapons that automatically hit their target.
