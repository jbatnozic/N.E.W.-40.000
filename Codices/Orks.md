# Codex: Orks

## Codex Special Rules

  ### 'Ere We Go:
  During the Fight phase, the Attack and Initiative characteristics of models in this unit are increased by 1 if:
  - The unit made a Charge move in the previous Charge phase;
  - The unit is not In Disarray.

  ### Breakin' 'Eads:
  **Note:** This special rule can be conferred to a unit by a model in that unit and/or by a nearby CHARACTER.

  When testing Morale for this unit, then after determining the result of the test (which is most commonly
  2D6 + current Strain), but before determining the consequence of the test, you may roll up to 3 six-sided dice (but no
  more than the number of models currently in the unit, excluding the one conferring this special rule). For each die
  rolled, add 1 to the Nerve characteristic of this unit for the duration of this Morale test only, but then after 
  determining the consequence of the test, the unit suffers a mortal wound for each 1 or 2 rolled.

  ### WAAAGH!
  If your WARLORD is a WARBOSS, then once per battle, in your Command phase, you can call a Waaagh!. To do so, that 
  WARBOSS must be on the battlefield or embarked on a TRANSPORT that is on the battlefield.

  A Waaagh! has two stages. The first stage is active from when the Waaagh! is called, and lasts until the start of your
  next Command phase. When the first stage ends, the second stage starts, and lasts until the start of your subsequent
  Command phase. After this point, the Waaagh! is no longer active, and has no further effect.

  **Stage 1: Call Da Waaagh!**
  - If an ORKS CORE or ORKS CHARACTER unit from your army makes an Advance move this turn, unexhaust it immediately
    afterwards. It does NOT count as having Advanced during this turn (but does count as having moved normally).
  - Add 1 to the Strength and Attacks characteristics of ORKS models from your army.
  - (5+ FnP?)

  **Stage 2: Get Stuck In!**

## Ork Clans (or Klans? idk)

If your army includes any ORKS units, select which Clan they are from. Their \<CLAN\> keyword is replaced with
the appropriate name (BAD MOONS for Bad Moons, GOFFS for Goffs - you get the idea). Each of these units gains
the Clan-specific 'Kultur' as a special rule. The Clan-specific Stratagem, Relic and Warlord Trait are also
unlocked for your army to use.

  ### Bad Moons
  - **\[Kultur] - Armed To Da Teef:** TODO
  - **\[Stratagem] - Showin' Off (1CP):** Use this Stratagem when a BAD MOONS CORE unit from your army is selected
  to shoot. Until the end of the phase, the **Dakka! Dakka! Dakka!** quality triggers on a hit roll of 51+ (instead
  of 61+) for all weapons with this quality carried by models in this unit.

  more scores 1 additional hit.
  - **\[Stratagem] - Unbridled Carnage (2CP):** Use this Stratagem in the Fight phase when a GOFF CORE or GOFF CHARACTER
  unit from your army that has the "No Mukkin’ About" Clan Kultur is selected to fight. Until the end of the phase, each
  time a model in that unit makes an attack, it scores an additional hit on an unmodified hit roll of 5+ instead of 6.

## Weapons

### Qualities

**Dakka! Dakka! Dakka!:** Each time you roll a hit roll of 61 or more for a ranged attack made with this weapon,
immediately make an additional hit roll against the same target using the same weapon. These additional hit rolls _can_
themselves generate further hit rolls using this rule. When firing a weapon with randomly determined characteristics 
(e.g. a Bubblechukka), any additional hit rolls use the same characteristics as the hit roll that generated the
additional hit roll. This ability does not affect weapons that automatically hit their target.
